# Geomon-Android

My 4th semester project second part - Android

In here I was supposed to create an android application that would take your GPS location on Google Maps and would generate several markers
around you, which you would be able to later catch. Those markers will give you an unique Geomon, which has its own stats and levels.
You have also the possibility to level them up using the step counter and in the future maybe evolve them based on a certain condition.
Whenever you catch a Geomon, it is stored in your local database. I also had to make sure you could communicate with the central server,
so I made the communication using GSON, in order to translate the json massages.
